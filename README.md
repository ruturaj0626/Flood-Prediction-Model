  # Flood Prediction Model

  This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithms designed to predict the likelihood of floods in the state of Kerala, utilizing the Kerala flood dataset.

  The goal of this project is to develop a robust flood prediction model. Five prominent machine learning algorithms have been employed for comparison: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. By leveraging Kerala's rainfall data, the aim is to identify the most effective model for flood prediction.

  ## Dataset

  The Kerala flood dataset provides essential information for training and evaluating the flood prediction model. This dataset is crucial for understanding the relationship between rainfall patterns and potential flood occurrences.

  ## Dependencies

  Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

  - Python (>=3.6)
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn

  You can install these dependencies using pip:

  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

  ## Usage

  1. **Clone this repository:**

     git clone https://github.com/ruturaj0626/Flood-Prediction-Model.git
     cd Flood-Prediction-Model

  2. **Data Preparation:**

     Download and organize the Kerala flood dataset as needed.

  3. **Run the Models:**

     Explore and compare the predictive capabilities of KNN Classification, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms by running the provided scripts.

  ## Results

  Evaluate the performance of each algorithm and identify the most accurate flood prediction model based on your dataset.
